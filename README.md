# Predicting-the-Severity-of-Car-Accidents
My Capstone Project for IBM's Data Science Proffesional Certificate.
Using a dataset provided by the UK Department for Transport (Kaggle) effort was made in order to create a model which predicts the probability of an accident based on enviromental conditions or the driver's personal information (age, vehicle etc). The project includes Data Visualization & Preprocessing using Pandas and MatplotLib and classification modeling using Logistic Reggresion, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree Models.
